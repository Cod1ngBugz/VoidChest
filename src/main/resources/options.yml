# of the names below (vip, admin, etc). By default, players will have the default amount.
# If the default amount doesn't exist, the limit will automatically be 5.

# This is to ensure that if a voidchest is broken by an explosion or third party
# plugins, all data related to this voidchest are removed.
#
# 20 ticks being 1 second. 10 ticks being 0.5 seconds and so on.
# 100 ticks (default) being 5 seconds.

# ignore-item-meta explanation: should the item meta be ignored? If this is set to

# The mode is the prefered sell logic you'd like the plugin to use so as to choose
# the sell prices for items. 
# 
# In case of ShopGUIPlus, it will select the first available
# similar item that has a sell price from ShopGUIPlus's shop.
#
# In case of VoidChest, it chooses prices depending on the shop.yml file.
#
# Same thing for essentials, I think this part is covered.
#
# As for custom, in order to use this you'll have to create your own plugin that
# implements a specific interface and then apply that class on startup. This way,
# if you have the mode as "custom", your custom's plugin sell logic should be applied.
